## Introduction
I pre-processed the data and applied the Random Forests method for my prediction model.

## Pre-Processing

I applied 2 pre-processing steps
1. Used the NonZeroValues function to retain only non-zero values:
  ```
  nzv <- nearZeroVar(training)
  training1 <- training[, -nzv]
  ```

2. Removed variables that had all NAs in the test set. I did not want to do this, but I could not get the predict function to work when a variable in the test set had all NAs.
  ```
  a <- nearZeroVar(testing, saveMetrics = TRUE)
  nullsInTest <- rownames(subset(a,nzv==TRUE))
  training2 <- training1[,!(names(training1) %in% nullsInTest)]
  ```

At the end of pre-processing I had 59 variables

## Training

I did a 10-fold cross-validation, 10-times using  ```method="repeatedcv"```.

My model has .86 accuracy
