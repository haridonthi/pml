## Introduction
I pre-processed the data and applied the Random Forests method for my prediction model.

## Pre-Processing

I applied 2 pre-processing steps.

Step 1. Used the NonZeroValues function to retain only non-zero values:

  ```
  nzv <- nearZeroVar(training)
  training1 <- training[, -nzv]
  ```

Step 2. Removed variables that had all NAs in the test set. I did not want to do this, but I could not get the predict function to work when a variable in the test set had all NAs:

  ```
  a <- nearZeroVar(testing, saveMetrics = TRUE)
  nullsInTest <- rownames(subset(a,nzv==TRUE))
  training2 <- training1[,!(names(training1) %in% nullsInTest)]
  ```

At the end of pre-processing, my training dataset had 59 variables.

## Training

I did a 10-fold cross-validation, 10-times using  ```method="repeatedcv"```.

```
#rf - removed nullsInTest, 10-foldcv, 10-times,
fitControl <- trainControl(method = "repeatedcv", number = 10, repeats = 10)
rfFit3 <- train(classe ~ ., data = training2, method = "rf", trControl = fitControl)
rfFit3
```

My model has .86 accuracy
