## Introduction
I pre-processed the data and applied the Random Forests method for my prediction model.

## Pre-Processing

I applied 3 pre-processing steps.

Step 1. Used the nearZeroVar function to retain only non-zero values:

  ```
  nzv <- nearZeroVar(training)
  training1 <- training[, -nzv]
  ```

Step 2. Removed variables that had all NAs in the test set. I did not want to do this, but I could not get the predict function to work when a variable in the test set had all NAs:

  ```
  a <- nearZeroVar(testing, saveMetrics = TRUE)
  nullsInTest <- rownames(subset(a,nzv==TRUE))
  training2 <- training1[,!(names(training1) %in% nullsInTest)]
  ```

Step 3. Removed 3 variables subjectively""

  ```
  drops <- c("X","user_name","num_window")
  training3 <- training2[,!names(training2) %in% drops]
  ```

At the end of pre-processing, my training dataset had 59 variables.

## Training

I did a 2-fold cross-validation, 2-times using  ```method="repeatedcv"```.

  ```
  > set.seed(825)
  > 
  > #rf - removed nullsInTest, 2-fold,2-times,
  > fitControl <- trainControl(method = "repeatedcv", number = 2, repeats = 2)
  > rfFit <- train(classe ~ ., data = training3, method = "rf", trControl = fitControl)
  > rfFit
  Random Forest 
  
  19622 samples
     55 predictor
      5 classes: 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E' 
  
  No pre-processing
  Resampling: Cross-Validated (2 fold, repeated 2 times) 
  
  Summary of sample sizes: 9810, 9812, 9811, 9811 
  
  Resampling results across tuning parameters:
  
    mtry  Accuracy   Kappa      Accuracy SD   Kappa SD   
     2    0.9871828  0.9837831  0.0010796399  0.001366566
    37    0.9975028  0.9968414  0.0009434239  0.001193230
    73    0.9967893  0.9959389  0.0009615179  0.001216269
  
  Accuracy was used to select the optimal model using  the largest value.
  The final value used for the model was mtry = 37. 
  ```

My model has .99 accuracy. The model was able to predict all the 20 tests correctly.
